*See EasySearch in action: Press `Shift+F`, type your search query, navigate with arrow keys, and open files instantly!*

## Important: Change keybinding & use VS Code's Native Search Shortcut for EasySearch

By default, EasySearch uses `Shift+F` as its keyboard shortcut. However, if you prefer using VS Code's native search shortcut (`Cmd+Shift+F` on macOS, `Ctrl+Shift+F` on Windows/Linux), you can easily set this up:

1. Open Command Palette (`Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS, `Ctrl+Shift+P` on Windows/Linux)
2. Type "Preferences: Open Keyboard Shortcuts (JSON)"
3. Add these entries to your `keybindings.json`:

```jsonc
{
    "key": "cmd+shift+f",
    "command": "-workbench.action.findInFiles",
    "when": "isMac"
},
{
    "key": "ctrl+shift+f",
    "command": "-workbench.action.findInFiles",
    "when": "isLinux || isWindows"
},
{
    "key": "cmd+shift+f",
    "command": "easySearch.searchInFiles",
    "when": "isMac"
},
{
    "key": "ctrl+shift+f",
    "command": "easySearch.searchInFiles",
    "when": "isLinux || isWindows"
},
{
  "key": "shift+f",
  "command": "-easySearch.searchInFiles"
}
```

4. Save the file and reload VS Code (`Cmd+Shift+P` → "Developer: Reload Window")

Now you can use default VS Code's native `Cmd+Shift+F` / `Ctrl+Shift+F` shortcut for EasySearch.
